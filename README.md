# Unsupervised_learning_Clustering_Bank_Marketing
By using clustering models (kmeans++,hierarchical, kmodes, kprototypes) we identified customer groups (clusters) for target marketing.<br>
By using different clustering algorithmns - Kmeans,Hierarchical,Kmodes,KPrototypes I have identified clusters from the bank+marketing data set given
<ol>
<li>Kmeans-Clustering_Bank_Marketing is used to identify 3 clusters based on numerical data using KMeans and hierarchical algorithms</li>
<li>K-Mode+Bank+Marketing is used to identify 2 clusters based on categorical data using KModes algorithms </li>
<li>K-Prototype+Bank+Marketing is used to identify 4 clusters based on both categorical and numerical data using KPrototypes algorithms </li>
<li>bank marketing csv file is provided ,using this data set the clusters are identified.</li>
</ol>
